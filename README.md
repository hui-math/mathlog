* Reading Janson's _Gaussian Hilbert spaces_, I wonder if the momentum operator $P(\xi)$ associated to a Gaussian $\xi$ is related to the directional derivative $\partial_\xi$ inthe Malliavin calculus?
In the finite dimensional Euclidean space, we know these two operators are related (up to a constant $i$ or $2\pi i$, depending on the definition of the Fourier transform of course). It would be interested to know if it is still the case in the Gaussian calculus.
An affirmative answer to this question, I imagine, would be important if one tries to develop microlocal analysis in a infinite dimensional space.
