Reading Janson's _Gaussian Hilbert spaces_, I wonder if the _momentum operator_ $P(\xi)$ associated to a Gaussian $\xi$ is related to the _directional derivative_ $\partial_\xi$ inthe Malliavin calculus?
In the finite dimensional Euclidean space, we know these two operators are related (up to a constant $i$ or $2\pi i$, depending on the definition of the Fourier transform of course). It would be interested to know if it is still the case in the Gaussian calculus.
An affirmative answer to this question, I imagine, would be important if one tries to develop microlocal analysis in a infinite dimensional space.

Update: I just realized that $\partial_\xi = A(\xi)$, the annihilation operator. Yes, of course! Each of them kills one copy of $\xi$ from a Wick polynomial.

A conection between the _Fourier--Wiener_ transform and the usual _Fourier transform_ in Euclidean spaces is given. I observe that such a connection is linked via a conjugation by _quadratic oscillations_. It is natural to ask if such a connection can be found for fractional dispersion relations? Precisely, is there an explicit formula that relates some well-defined _fractional Fourier transform_ and the calculus of some fractional stochastic process (just as Laskin did in deriving the fractional Schr√∂dinger equation?)
